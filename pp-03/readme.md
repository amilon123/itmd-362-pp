1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13v0u0koKDhbuVXbuVXN4r9N4r9
Your Rationale: Typically game consoles are advertised with a dark theme for the
background. However, I have noticed that advertising methods have started to adopt a lighter palette. Therefore, I tried to find a balance between the two different approaches in designing for video games. I chose to create a blue monochromatic color palette because of its association with inspiration, imagination, and freedom. The colors are very unintimidating to a point where it creates an environment of order and calmness. A new console gaming platform would sell itself next to these colors.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=55r0r1klSsBvjtdvjtdespAespAklSsBvjtdvjtdespAespAk0AUu13J613J600++00++
Your Rationale: I looked at the Chicago Botanical Gardens website to see what kind of color palettes they had in place, but I wasn't that impressed with their ability to push the envelope. Therefore, I took it upon myself to look at springtime photos on Google images for some inspiration. I stumbled across a beautiful picture of a garden filled with fuchsia, orange, and purple tulips. I felt that the purple was too dark for the springtime theme, so I did not include it in the palette. I kept the orange and made the fuchsia softer, which ended up to look more pink. I felt that the palette was still not light enough, so I added a dull shade of white to stay consistent with the website's background for the Chicago Botanical Gardens.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=51+140kNtM7HhYrHhYrFUodFUod
Your Rationale: Again, I conducted a bit of research to color theory and what I found is that orange increases alertness, yellow maintains attention, and green adds calmness. Therefore, I dedicated the color palette to those three colors. I made all three of them bright and pigmented. I didn't want to wash out the colors because of the fact that I wanted the orange and yellow to really pop, especially for kids who are beginning to learn the alphabet.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=c3y3+3L3k1kqvZDhDUfhDUfRLvZRLvZkuCPPqRRnqRRnDRuuDRuukpsfMmLjgmLjgs487s487k7IZE3A+K3A+KdpRgdpRg
Your Rationale: Every time I see something associated with cybersecurity, it revolves around the color blue or green. I have noticed that the shade of blue cybersecurity advertising takes on is lighter. Therefore, I took the more traditional route with using blue because I feel that it really is the best color to use since it is associated with security. I made a powder blue instead of the aqua blue to give the students assessing the course a break away from the bolder blues. I thought that the course site could take on a dark on light approach to make the content less intimidating.
