# Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists each containing at least 25 items (use Google,
but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own,
condensed list of exactly ten items.

Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create
your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

1. https://stayintech.com/UX
2. https://html.com/blog/website-testing-usability-checklist/

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1. Transparent pricing. Prices are clearly displayed. There are no hidden costs or surprises in the terms. (We didn't put prices on anything)
2. Links, buttons and checkboxes are easily clickable (Images on pizza builder should be clickable, not just the title)
3. Use color, position, size, and more to create a specific flow for your site. (Pizza builder might want to be restructured with Javascript)
4. Browser compatibility. Site works in various browsers. (Only checked with Firefox Developer)
5. Simplicity. Only absolutely necessary questions are asked in forms. (checkout form)
6. Form submission is confirmed, so that the user knows data was successfully sent. (No forms did this)
7. Error messages are shown next to the input field, not just on top of the page. (No forms did this)
8. Be sure that even if your site canâ€™t display certain elements, the rest will still function properly. (Java-less people)
9. Differentiate between visited and unvisited links so that visitors can navigate with ease.
10. Cut down on unnecessary animations to avoid overwhelming the user. (We should have 1 slideshow on the home page at least of classic pizzas)
