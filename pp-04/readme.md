# Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android/Google, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).
Focus on touch-related elements.

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Android:
  https://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

### Redesign with Android

* HCI Guideline One (URL):  https://material.io/guidelines/components/bottom-navigation.html#bottom-navigation-usage
* How you implemented it in your sketch:  The main issue I have with IIT's login
page is that it's extremely messy! There is too much information and, as a
result, the site has little-to-no control over the content. There is also no
clear understanding of where to start and the focal point of the page (login) is
easily overlooked as its position isn't obvious. I think most of their issues
come from the fact that they do not have a design for mobile devices. Therefore,
I thought that the Android guideline for bottom navigation on mobile devices
would work beautifully for IIT's login page as they clearly want to advertise
other top-level views. I was consistent with that design when drawing for tablet
and desktop scales by incorporating side navigation.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL):  https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html#color-color-system
* How you implemented it in your sketch:  IIT's site is really blan and boring,
especially for a college of technology. I stuck with the Android guideline for
customizing the site's color scheme to match the brand's colors. Therefore, I
took IIT's school colors and made a fun complementary palette of scarlet
colors with some grey (inactive) and white (active) for the icons. I really
wanted the site's primary color to be scarlet red; secondary color would be an
orange/yellow; text would be black; text-fields would be light grey; login
button would be dark grey. I would also incorporate the skyline because I
think it is too much of a powerful photo to get rid of.
* Sketch:  guideline2

* HCI Guidline Three (URL):  https://material.io/guidelines/patterns/errors.html#errors-user-input-errors
* How you implemented it in your sketch:  IIt's page is notorious for taking
people to a completely different screen when user information is invalid,
which is completely annoying to practically everyone. Therefore, I thought
that Android's guideline for user input errors would do the site some good and
cause less frustration when making errors on the page. When the user enters
invalid information the helpful text provided to the user will turn into error
messages in a completely different color to signify to the user where the
error lies. The form would still have to be submitted in order to determine if
the fields are valid or if there has been any information entered. Time to
upgrade!
